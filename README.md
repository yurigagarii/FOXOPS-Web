          📁 [SYSTEM UPDATE: FOXOPS v3.0 ONLINE] 📁
================================================================================

Agents, the wait is over! Our server infrastructure has been completely 
overhauled and the FOXOPS v3.0 Operating System is now live. We no longer 
have just a bot; we have a living, breathing, futuristic assistant that 
reacts to you and rewards your presence.

   - Command: /missions
   - Detail: Daily refreshing mission list. "Send 50 messages", "Play 3 coinflips" 
     and more. Complete objectives and secure the bag. Faster than a Valo BP!

🏷️ [ DYNAMIC TAGS (AUTO-METADATA) ]

🎮 [ RIOT GAMES INTELLIGENCE ]
   - Commands: /valo-profile, /valo-matches, /lol-profile, /lol-live

     Our RSS agents leak the freshest updates directly to the server.

📦 [ TACTICAL AIRDROP (SUPPLY BOX) ]

     takes the prize. Slow hands get nothing but logs!
